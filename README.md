ino is the protocol for dares on-chain. With ino, anyone can create a market for a fundraise to obtain proof of dares being completed. If $69,000 is raised in the pool, creators can claim their funds after verifying they own the linked account on twitter and uploaded an image or video that satisfies the constraints of the dare. A memecoin is then distributed pro-rata to all funders of the dare with 10% of fundriase used to pair locked memecoin liquidity, creating infinitely tradeable memorabilia of the dare.

If crypto consumer has taught us anything is that it needs to be simple, social, and fun. ino fills all those needs and more. Try it out on your home computer soon!
